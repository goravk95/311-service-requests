## Key Features

### H3 Spatial Grouping
- **Resolution 8** hexagonal cells (~0.7 km² area)
- Efficient neighbor aggregations (k=1 ring)
- Validates lat/lon and handles missing coordinates
- Maps to FIPS counties for weather joins

### Sparse Panels
- **No dense calendar expansion** - only creates rows for existing data
- Typically **>90% sparsity** (avoiding millions of empty rows)
- Per-group lag/rolling features via dict lookups
- Memory-efficient for large datasets

### Leakage Prevention
- **Zero future information** in features
- As-of joins for historical aggregates
- No use of `status`, `closed_date`, `resolution_*` fields
- Comprehensive validation checks

### Feature Categories

#### Forecast Panel (Time-Series)
- **Target:** Ticket count per (hex, complaint_family, day)
- **History:** lag1, lag7, roll7, roll14, roll28, momentum, days_since_last
- **Neighbors:** nbr_roll7, nbr_roll28 (H3 k=1 ring)
- **Calendar:** dow, month
- **Weather:** tavg, prcp, heating_degree, cooling_degree, rain_3d, rain_7d
- **Population:** log_pop (from census block groups)

#### Triage Features (Classification)
- **Temporal:** hour, dow, month, is_weekend, is_created_at_midnight
- **Categorical:** One-hot encoding for complaint_family, borough, channel, etc.
- **Local History:** geo_family_roll7, geo_family_roll28 (as-of)
- **Repeat Site:** repeat_site_14d, repeat_site_28d (using BBL or address hash)
- **Due Date:** due_gap_hours, due_is_60d, due_crosses_weekend
- **Weather:** tavg, prcp, heat_flag (>90°F), freeze_flag (<32°F)
- **Text:** TF-IDF sparse matrix from descriptor_clean (1-2 grams, min_df=5)

#### Duration Features (Survival)
All triage features plus:
- **Queue Pressure:** intake_6h, intake_24h (rolling counts in region+family)
- **Backlog:** open_7d_geo_family (proxy for open queue)

#### Duration Labels
- **ttc_days_cens** - Censored duration (capped at 60.5 or 365)
- **event_observed** - 1 if true closure, 0 if censored
- **is_admin_like** - Flag for 59-62 day auto-close
- **Censoring rules:**
  - Admin auto-close: [59, 62] days → censored at 60.5
  - Long stale: >365 days → censored at 365
  - Open tickets: No closed_date → censored at 365

## Technical Highlights

### Performance
- **Vectorized operations** throughout (no Python row loops)
- **Dict-based lag features** for sparse data
- **Cumulative sum approach** for rolling features
- **Grouped as-of joins** for historical features
- **Sparse TF-IDF** for text (not dense)

### Data Quality
- Validates lat/lon ranges (-90/90, -180/180)
- Handles missing values gracefully (fills with 0 or "_missing")
- Filters invalid H3 cells
- Caps one-hot encoding to top 10 categories per feature

### Modularity
- Clean separation of utils and main features
- Each function is independent and composable
- Type hints and docstrings throughout
- Easy to extend with new features

## Usage Example

```python
from src.features import *

# Load data
df = pd.read_parquet('data/landing/311-service-requests/...')

# Add H3 keys
df = add_h3_keys(df, lat='latitude', lon='longitude', res=8)

# Build features for your model type
forecast_panel = build_forecast_panel(df, weather_df=weather)
triage_features, tfidf, vectorizer = build_triage_features(df)
duration_labels = build_duration_survival_labels(df)
duration_features = build_duration_features(df)

# Train models
from lightgbm import LGBMRegressor
model = LGBMRegressor()
model.fit(forecast_panel[feature_cols], forecast_panel['y'])
```

## Validation

1. **Leakage detection** - Scans for prohibited columns
2. **Sparsity validation** - Confirms >90% sparse panels
3. **Missing value check** - Reports missing critical features

```

## Architecture Decisions

### Why H3?
- Standard hexagonal grid (better than arbitrary polygons)
- Efficient neighbor queries
- Hierarchical zoom levels
- Industry standard (Uber, etc.)

### Why Sparse Panels?
- Memory efficiency (avoid 10M+ empty rows)
- Faster computation (only process actual data)
- Scales to full 15-year dataset

### Why As-Of Joins?
- Bulletproof leakage prevention
- Natural for time-series data
- Easy to validate and audit

### Why Censoring?
- Admin auto-close at ~60 days is not a "real" closure
- Long stale tickets (>365d) are likely data quality issues
- Survival models need proper censoring for accuracy

## Known Limitations

1. **H3 resolution fixed at 8** - Could make configurable
2. **Weather at county level** - Could interpolate to hex level
3. **Population from census blocks** - Approximate mapping to H3
4. **TF-IDF limited to 500 features** - Could increase for more text signal
5. **Neighbor aggregation can be slow** - Could optimize with spatial indexes
