# Changes Summary

## ✅ Major Changes Completed

### 1. Weather Feature Engineering Moved to Preprocessing

**Problem:** Weather features were computed in both preprocessing and feature engineering, causing duplication.

**Solution:** Consolidated all weather feature engineering into `src/preprocessing.py`.

#### Changes in `src/preprocessing.py`

Added four new functions:

1. **`convert_weather_units(df)`** - **⭐ NEW: Unit Conversion**:
   - Converts temperatures from **Celsius to Fahrenheit** (°F = °C × 9/5 + 32)
   - Converts precipitation from **tenths of mm to inches** (inches = tenths_mm / 10 / 25.4)
   - NOAA nClimGrid data comes in metric units, now converted to US standard

2. **`add_weather_derived_features(df)`** - Computes derived weather features:
   - `heating_degree` = max(0, 65 - tavg) in °F
   - `cooling_degree` = max(0, tavg - 65) in °F
   - `heat_flag` = 1 if tmax ≥ 90°F
   - `freeze_flag` = 1 if tmin ≤ 32°F
   - Assumes temperatures already in Fahrenheit

3. **Rolling precipitation** (integrated in `add_weather_derived_features`):
   - `rain_3d` = 3-day rolling sum per FIPS (in inches)
   - `rain_7d` = 7-day rolling sum per FIPS (in inches)

4. **Updated `merge_weather_data()`** - **⭐ KEY OPTIMIZATION:**
   - Computes ALL weather features on the weather DataFrame **before** merging
   - Pipeline: Load → Convert Units → Derive Features → Merge
   - Much more efficient since weather data has ~10K rows vs millions in ticket data
   - All unit conversions, derived and rolling features computed on small DataFrame first
   - Then merges everything at once

**Result:** Weather features are computed once during preprocessing, in US units (°F and inches), on the small weather DataFrame for maximum efficiency, and available to all downstream tasks.

#### Changes in `src/features.py`

**Simplified** `build_forecast_panel()` and `build_triage_features()`:
- ✅ Removed all weather feature checks and backward compatibility code
- ✅ Assumes weather features are already present from preprocessing
- ✅ Removed `weather_df` parameter from `build_forecast_panel()`
- ✅ Cleaner, simpler code - ~60 lines removed

**New Workflow (Only Way):**
```python
# Weather features MUST be present from preprocessing
df = preprocess_and_merge_external_data()  # Weather features computed here
df = add_h3_keys(df)
panel = build_forecast_panel(df)  # Simple - no weather_df parameter

# ❌ Old workflow no longer supported
# panel = build_forecast_panel(df, weather_df=weather)  # Parameter removed
```

### 2. Documentation Reorganized and Consolidated

**Problem:** 8 separate README/SUMMARY files with significant overlap and redundancy.

**Solution:** Created a streamlined `docs/` structure with clear organization.

#### New Documentation Structure

```
docs/
├── README.md                 # Documentation index
├── QUICK_START.md           # 5-minute getting started guide
├── FEATURES.md              # Complete feature engineering guide
├── TRAINING.md              # Complete training guide
└── API_REFERENCE.md         # Comprehensive API documentation
```

#### Files Deleted (Redundant)

- ❌ `src/FEATURE_ENGINEERING_README.md` → Consolidated into `docs/FEATURES.md`
- ❌ `src/QUICK_START.md` → Consolidated into `docs/QUICK_START.md`
- ❌ `src/README_FEATURES.md` → Replaced by `docs/README.md`
- ❌ `TRAINING_README.md` → Consolidated into `docs/TRAINING.md`
- ❌ `TRAINING_SUMMARY.md` → Content merged into `docs/TRAINING.md`
- ❌ `FEATURE_ENGINEERING_SUMMARY.md` → Content merged into `docs/FEATURES.md`

#### Files Kept

- ✅ `models/README.md` - Short module overview (different purpose)
- ✅ `README.md` - Main project README (updated with links to docs/)

#### Main README Updated

Added documentation section to `README.md`:

```markdown
## 📚 Documentation

**New to the project?** Start with the [Quick Start Guide](docs/QUICK_START.md)

## 📊 Before vs After

### Before

```
├── README.md (outdated)
├── FEATURE_ENGINEERING_SUMMARY.md
├── TRAINING_README.md
├── TRAINING_SUMMARY.md
└── src/
    ├── FEATURE_ENGINEERING_README.md
    ├── QUICK_START.md
    ├── README_FEATURES.md
    ├── preprocessing.py (basic weather merge)
    └── features.py (duplicated weather calcs)
```

**Problems:**
- 8 documentation files with overlaps
- Weather features computed twice
- Hard to navigate
- Inconsistent style

### After

```
├── README.md (updated with docs links)
├── docs/
│   ├── README.md (documentation index)
│   ├── QUICK_START.md (consolidated)
│   ├── FEATURES.md (consolidated + weather notes)
│   ├── TRAINING.md (consolidated)
│   └── API_REFERENCE.md (new)
├── src/
│   ├── preprocessing.py (✨ weather features HERE)
│   └── features.py (✨ uses pre-computed weather)
└── models/
    └── README.md (short overview)
```

**Benefits:**
- 5 clear documentation files
- Weather features computed once
- Easy navigation
- Consistent structure

---

## 🎯 Key Improvements

### 1. Single Source of Truth for Weather

All weather feature engineering is now in one place: `src/preprocessing.py`

**Why this matters:**
- No duplication of logic
- Consistent feature definitions
- Easier to maintain
- **Much faster** - Features computed on weather DataFrame (~10K rows) **before** merge, not after merge (millions of rows)
- Compute once, use everywhere

### 2. Clear Documentation Hierarchy

```
README.md                  → Project overview + links to docs
docs/QUICK_START.md       → Get started in 5 minutes
docs/FEATURES.md          → Deep dive into features
docs/TRAINING.md          → Deep dive into training
docs/API_REFERENCE.md     → Complete API reference
```

**Learning path:**
1. Start with QUICK_START.md (5 min)
2. Read FEATURES.md if building features (20 min)
3. Read TRAINING.md if training models (20 min)
4. Reference API_REFERENCE.md as needed (30 min)

### 3. Breaking Change - Workflow Required

**BREAKING:** The `weather_df` parameter has been removed from `build_forecast_panel()`.

```python
# ✅ Required workflow
df = preprocess_and_merge_external_data()  # Weather features computed here
df = add_h3_keys(df)
panel = build_forecast_panel(df)  # No weather_df parameter

# ❌ Old workflow no longer works
# panel = build_forecast_panel(df, weather_df=weather)  # Error: unexpected parameter
```

**Why this change?**
- Forces users to use the correct, efficient preprocessing workflow
- Eliminates confusion about where weather features come from
- Cleaner API - simpler function signatures
- No performance penalty for checking backward compatibility

## 📝 Usage Changes

### Before (Old Workflow - No Longer Works)

```python
# Step 1: Preprocess
df = preprocess_and_merge_external_data()

# Step 2: Load weather separately
weather = pd.read_csv('weather.csv')

# Step 3: Build features (weather computed again)
df = add_h3_keys(df)
panel = build_forecast_panel(df, weather_df=weather)  # ❌ Parameter removed!
```

### After (New Workflow - Required)

```python
# Step 1: Preprocess (weather features computed once on small df)
df = preprocess_and_merge_external_data()
# Now df includes weather in US units (°F and inches):
#   - Base: tavg, tmax, tmin (°F), prcp (inches)
#   - Derived: heating_degree, cooling_degree, heat_flag, freeze_flag
#   - Rolling: rain_3d, rain_7d (inches)

# Step 2: Build features (uses pre-computed weather)
df = add_h3_keys(df)
panel = build_forecast_panel(df)  # ✅ Simple! No weather_df parameter
```

**Result:** Cleaner, faster, no duplication, no confusion. All weather data in US standard units.

## 🔍 Implementation Details

### Weather Features Added to Preprocessing

**Unit Conversions (applied first):**
- Temperature: **Celsius → Fahrenheit** (°F = °C × 9/5 + 32)
- Precipitation: **Tenths of mm → Inches** (inches = tenths_mm / 10 / 25.4)

**Base Features (merged, in US units):**
- `tavg` - Average temperature (°F)
- `tmax` - Maximum temperature (°F)
- `tmin` - Minimum temperature (°F)
- `prcp` - Precipitation (inches)

**Derived Features (computed):**
- `heating_degree` = max(0, 65 - tavg) - Heating degree days (°F)
- `cooling_degree` = max(0, tavg - 65) - Cooling degree days (°F)
- `heat_flag` = 1 if tmax ≥ 90°F - Heat wave indicator
- `freeze_flag` = 1 if tmin ≤ 32°F - Freeze indicator

**Rolling Features (computed):**
- `rain_3d` - 3-day rolling precipitation sum (inches, by FIPS)
- `rain_7d` - 7-day rolling precipitation sum (inches, by FIPS)

### Code Changes

**`src/preprocessing.py`:**
- ✅ Added `convert_weather_units()` - **NEW: Celsius to Fahrenheit, tenths of mm to inches**
- ✅ Added `add_weather_derived_features()` - Degree days and extreme flags
- ✅ Rolling precipitation integrated into `add_weather_derived_features()`
- ✅ Updated `merge_weather_data()` - Pipeline: Load → Convert → Derive → Merge

**`src/features.py`:**
- ✅ Removed `weather_df` parameter from `build_forecast_panel()`
- ✅ Removed all weather feature checking/computation code (~60 lines)
- ✅ Assumes weather features (in US units) are present from preprocessing
- ✅ Added backward compatibility notes

**`src/utils.py`:**
- ℹ️ Weather functions kept for backward compatibility but deprecated
- ℹ️ Functions documented to point to `preprocessing.py`
